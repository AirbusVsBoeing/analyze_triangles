1. File: mol_yeast_spliceosome.txt

Summary: This file contains the adjacency matrix that depicts the network of proteins in the yeast spliceosome. We retrieved 103 spliceosome proteins from the STRING database [1; http://string-db.org]. The rows and columns contain each protein (nodes) and the cell values (links) are the level of support for the occurrence of interaction between them (i.e. probability that interaction is correct). This reliability score comes from the combination of different experimental evidences, and goes from zero (no evidence) to one (strong support for interaction).

4. File: ind_craniam.txt

Summary: This file contains the adjacency matrix that depicts the network representations of a complex morphological structure, the human cranium. In this morphological network, nodes represented anatomically-defined measurements between landmarks points, and links represented the Pearson correlation coefficients among the measurements between the landmarks [1]. We analyzed 44 cranial measurements from a sample of 1367 male individuals from 30 recent modern human populations distributed worldwide [2]. In this file, we averaged the 44 cranial measurements for each of the 30 populations, so the row and columns are the measurements and the cell values are the Pearson correlation.
